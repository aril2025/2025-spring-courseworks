# Advanced Digital Fabrication and Practice
<!-- This course aims at realizing ideas using digital fabrication machines. Students learn by practicing 3D modeling tools, 3D printers, computer controlled cutting machines, and industrial robotic arms. In the class, a micro-controller will be fabricated directly with electronic components along with making a mock-up and dynamic parts. Students will design and fabricate prototypes during one semester using various digital fabrication techniques learned through class. -->
